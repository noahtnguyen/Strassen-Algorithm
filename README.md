# Strassen-Algorithm

Strassen's algorithm, proposed by Volker Strassen in 1969, is an algorithm for matrix multiplication that breaks down the problem into a set of seven smaller multiplication tasks, rather than the traditional eight. This approach results in a lower time complexity than the standard matrix multiplication algorithm.

This repository includes the implementation of Stassen Algorithm in C++ and a complexity analysis report.
